# Error Handling Tasks

## Current Implementation Status
- [x] Defined custom exception hierarchy for model-related errors
  - ModelCreationError, ModelConfigError, ModelInitializationError implemented
- [x] Implemented error recovery mechanisms in factory classes
  - ModelFactory includes robust recovery manager and retry logic
- [x] Added comprehensive error logging in model creation and initialization
  - Detailed logging implemented in ModelFactory for tracking creation process
- [x] Implemented field-specific validation and error handling
  - Data type validation for Work Order Number and Total Amount
  - Format preservation and normalization during loading

## Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
- [ ] Implement error monitoring and alerting system
  - Set up error tracking for production environment
  - Configure alerts for critical failures
  - Create error reporting dashboard

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Enhance error recovery mechanisms for prompt generation
  - Implement retry logic for prompt template loading
  - Add fallback strategies for prompt formatting
  - Create custom exceptions for prompt-related errors

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and degradation detection
  - Track model inference times
  - Monitor resource usage
  - Alert on performance degradation

## Implementation Guidelines

### Exception Hierarchy
```python
# Base domain exception
class DomainError(Exception):
    """Base exception for domain-specific errors."""
    pass
    
# Component-specific exceptions
class ModelError(DomainError):
    """Base exception for model-related errors."""
    pass
    
# Specific error conditions
class ModelInitializationError(ModelError):
    """Raised when model initialization fails."""
    pass
```

### Error Recovery Pattern
- Implement recovery managers for critical operations
- Use retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Provide clear error messages with context
- Clean up resources in case of failures

### Error Logging Requirements
- Log all errors with stack traces
- Include relevant context in error messages
- Use appropriate log levels (ERROR for failures, WARNING for recoverable issues)
- Track error frequencies and patterns

### Validation Requirements
- Validate all inputs at system boundaries
- Implement field-specific validation rules
- Log validation failures with context
- Handle missing or malformed data gracefully

## Success Criteria
- All errors are properly caught and handled
- Error messages are clear and actionable
- Resources are properly cleaned up after errors
- Error recovery mechanisms are tested and reliable
- Error monitoring provides useful insights
