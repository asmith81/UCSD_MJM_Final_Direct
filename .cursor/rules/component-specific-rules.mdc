- Provide sensible defaults where appropriate
- Document all configuration options

### Model Management

- Ensure consistent interface across all models
- Handle resources appropriately (load/unload)
- Document model capabilities and limitations
- Clear separation between model and inference logic

### Prompt Management
- Use template pattern for prompt generation
- Document prompt strategies clearly
- Ensure prompts are configurable via YAML
- Keep prompt logic separate from model logic
- Version prompt templates explicitly

### Evaluation Framework
- Clearly define all metrics
- Consistent evaluation across all models/prompts
- Document evaluation methodology
- Store results in standardized format
- Provide clear visualizations of results
