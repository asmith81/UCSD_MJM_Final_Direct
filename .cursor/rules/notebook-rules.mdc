## Notebook Rules

### Structure
- Each notebook must be self-contained
- Clear separation between configuration and execution
- Standard sections: imports, configuration, execution, results
- No business logic in notebooks
- Results should be saved to disk in standardized format

### Style
- Use markdown cells for section headers
- Keep code cells short and focused
- Include comments explaining complex operations
- Use standard variable names across notebooks
- Clean up resources explicitly when done
